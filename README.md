### What Motivates Me

> I find purpose in projects that reflect a commitment to ethical considerations, emphasizing transparency, fairness, and social impact, while introducing innovative solutions in their respective domains. 

These are the projects I launched lately:

  - **Objective**: Open-source library for handling offers, payments, and credit management.
  - **Ethical Aspect**: Promotes pay-as-you-go in small startups, bringing fairness in access to financial tools.
  - **Originality**: Enables businesses to own their data while reducing dependency on a single payment platform.

#### 2. [CvLink](https://cvlink.in)

  - **Objective**: AI-powered resume editor with multiple template possibilities.
  - **Ethical Aspect**: Empowers individuals in tailoring resumes to offer ads, as recruiters filter them out through AI.
  - **Originality**: Allows users to download resumes in JSON format, promoting openness and interoperability, preventing recruiting platforms from owning job searchers' data.

#### 3. [WeAlly](https://WeAlly.org)

  - **Objective**: Platform for gathering people around grievances to crowdfund for solutions.
  - **Ethical Aspect**: Direct citizen empowerment, bypassing the need for non-profits in addressing societal issues by the people.
